<p style="text-align-last: center;">After walking through the forest for a while, Flora and Milo came up upon the daisies they were looking for. However, there was only one.</p>

<p style="text-align-last: center;">Flora and Milo decide to get the flower anyways. They agree that they will decide who will get the daisy later. So as they reach for it...</p>
    
    <img class="resized-image2 center" src="Reaching.JPG" alt= "Flora and Milo reaching for the flower">
    
<p style="text-align-last: center;">...the flower is suddenly taken! In a whoosh of a black shadow, a cat runs by, snatching the flower before Milo or Flora has the chance to realize what has happened.</p>
